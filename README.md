# WebExpress
WebExpress is a lightweight web server optimized for use in low-performance environments (e.g. Rasperry PI). By providing 
a powerful plugin system and a comprehensive API, web applications can be easily and quickly integrated into a .net 
language (e.g. C#). Some advantages of WebExpress are:

- It is easy to use.
- It offers a variety of features and tools that can help you build and manage your website.
- It is fast and efficient and can help you save time and money.
- It is flexible and can be customized to meet your specific requirements.

# WebExpress.WebIndex
WebExpress.WebIndex is part of the WebExpress family. The project provides a reverse index 
to enable a quick and efficient search for data. The index can be filtered using the 
wql (webexpress query language). Even though the reverse index is part of the WebExpress 
family, it can also be used in other projects (outside of WebExpress).
